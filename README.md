## FOAM BASE:
It is a material for adhesion parameters. Foam 3D printing is more sustainable and resource-efficient than conventional foam construction. Inorganic foams are more environmentral friendly and safe print materials than organic foams.

## BUILD PLATFORM:
In Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing, the build platform serves as the base on which the object is constructed layer by layer. It provides a stable foundation for the initial layers and helps ensure dimensional accuracy throughout the printing process. The build platform needs to have good adhesion properties to prevent warping and detachment of the printed layers. Additionally, leveling the build platform is crucial for uniform layer deposition, contributing to the overall print quality.

## EXTRUSION HEAD:
The extrusion head, also known as the hotend, is a critical component in the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing process. Its primary function is to melt and extrude the thermoplastic filament layer by layer to build the 3D object.The extrusion head plays a vital role in determining the print quality, resolution, and overall success of the FDM 3D printing process.

## EXTRUSION NOZZLE:
The extrusion nozzle is a crucial component in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing. It's responsible for melting and precisely depositing thermoplastic filament layer by layer to form 3D objects. The nozzle's diameter affects layer resolution and printing speed, with smaller nozzles providing finer details. Temperature control is essential to melt the filament properly, varying for different materials. The nozzle's movement is coordinated by the printer's system, determining the object's shape. Additionally, cooling systems on some nozzles help solidify the material swiftly, contributing to overall print quality, resolution, and the success of the FDM process.

## MATERIAL SPOOL:

## BUILD MATERIAL SPOOL:
The build material spool in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing holds the thermoplastic filament that is fed into the extrusion head during the printing process. It ensures a continuous supply of material for building layers of the 3D object. The spool must be properly loaded onto the 3D printer, and the filament is pulled from it as needed. Factors like filament type, color, and diameter are determined by the choice of material spool. Proper storage and management of the spool are crucial for preventing filament tangling and ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted flow of material throughout the 3D printing job.
FILAMENT:

Filament is a key material in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing. It is a thermoplastic material supplied in the form of a long, thin strand wound on a spool. The filament is fed into the extrusion head, where it is melted and extruded layer by layer to create a 3D object. Different filaments, such as PLA, ABS, or PETG, offer varying properties like strength, flexibility, and heat resistance. The choice of filament also influences factors such as print temperature, cooling requirements, and overall print quality. Filament selection is crucial in determining the physical and mechanical properties of the final 3D printed object.
